I'm sorry for the confusion, but the file `shiny-app.Rproj` is not a file that contains code. It's a project file generated by RStudio, which contains settings for your RStudio project. This file is usually generated when you create a new project in RStudio and it's not manually written by users. Therefore, it doesn't contain R code and it's not meant to be manually edited.

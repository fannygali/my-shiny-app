# My Shiny App

This is a simple Shiny application that allows you to visualize the histogram of numeric variables in a dataset. You can select the variable and the number of bins for the histogram.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. You also need to have the `shiny` package installed in R. You can install it using the following command:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, open the `runShinyApp.R` script in RStudio and click on the "Run" button. This will launch the Shiny application in your web browser.

## Using the Application

Once the application is running, you will see a dropdown menu and a slider. The dropdown menu allows you to select the variable for which you want to see the histogram. The slider allows you to select the number of bins for the histogram.

After selecting the variable and the number of bins, the histogram will be displayed below.
